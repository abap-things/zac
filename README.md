This tool is crafted to generate ABAP code specifically for scenarios that involve repetitive code patterns, influenced by semi-static conditions.

The tool works as follows:
1. First, we create a template for the desired code.
2. Then, in the ABAP program, we select the system data that will be used as parameters for the template.
3. In the same program, we execute the template transformation and obtain the text (ABAP code) in the format we desire.

For example, this section demonstrates code generation for static access to 'stvarv' parameters. The sample of its usage can be found here: 

1. main program: https://github.com/abap-things/zac/blob/master/src/samples/zac_sample_stvarv_1.prog.abap
2. code template: https://github.com/abap-things/zac/blob/master/src/samples/zac_sample_stvarv_template_1.prog.abap
3. result: https://github.com/abap-things/zac/blob/master/src/samples/result/zcl_ac_stvarv_sample_1.clas.abap

A code template consists of two text categories: static text with possible substitution elements and script language elements. Script language elements are prefixed with a predefined comment string, while static text includes all other types of text. The template is processed sequentially: static text is output as is, substitution elements are replaced with their current variable values, and script elements are executed in a classic imperative mode.

The script language incorporates elements of ABAP and supports the following features:
1. String and integer literals.
2. Evaluation of string, integer, and logical expressions using:
- Arithmetic operations: unary plus/minus, addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division;
- Logical operations: logical NOT, AND, OR, comparisons, and string operations like CS, CP, among others;
- Parentheses for grouping.
3. Dynamic variable definitions and assignments.
4. Conditional statements.
5. Limited form of the LOOP AT/ENDLOOP statement.
6. Limited form of the DO/ENDDO statement.
7. Control statements: EXIT, CONTINUE, and CHECK.
8. "Build-in" functions.
