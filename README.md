This tool is designed to generate abap code for certain dynamic conditions. As an example, in the current version, code generation for static access to stvarv variables is shown here. 

The sample of usage can be found in here: https://github.com/abap-things/zac/blob/master/src/samples/zac_sample_stvarv_1.prog.abap
